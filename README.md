#Noter

Noter is a lightweight responsive web app for taking simple and quick notes. In its current release, Noter is a fully functional CRUD application storing your notes in the browser's local storage. This project was built with ReactJs and TypeScript and has light and dark themes that are saved in browser storage as well. 

Next versions will be built with Supabase backend to handle login authentication as well as PostgreSQL for cross device note syncing.
